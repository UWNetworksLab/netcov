# NetCov
NetCov is an open-source tool that can be used with [Batfish](https://github.com/batfish/batfish) to analyze test coverage for network configurations. Given a set of Batfish queries, it analyzes which lines of configurations has/has not been covered. The result can be used to assess the rigorousness of the test suite and help discover the blind spots. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12870.pdf) for technical details.


NetCov is written in Python and can be used in concert with [pybatfish](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html), Batfish's Python API.

## Features

NetCov supports coverage tracking for the following [Batfish questions](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/questions.html):

- Reachability test via [traceroute](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/forwarding.html#Traceroute) question
- Routing policy evaluation via [testRoutePolicies](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingProtocols.html#Test-Route-Policies) question
- Direct inspection of routing tables via [routes](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#Routes) and [bgpRib](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#BGP-RIB) questions


NetCov supports configuration syntax of the following vendors:

|                    | Interface          | BGP neighbor       | Routing Policy     | Prefix list        | Community list     | As-path list       |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Cisco              | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Juniper            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Arista             | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Palo Alto Networks | :heavy_check_mark: |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |
| SONiC              |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |


If youâ€™d like support for additional [vendors](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_devices.html) (which are supported by Batfish but unsupported by NetCov) or currently-unsupported configuration features, let us know via [GitHub issue](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/issues). We'll try to add support, and it would help if you share a configuration example. You may want to use an [anonymizer](https://github.com/intentionet/netconan) before sharing.

NetCov reports configuration coverage as the percentage of configuration lines that are covered, such as:

NetCov can also report fine-grained coverage results as colored annotations on source configurations (lines in blue are covered, lines in red are not covered):

You can find an example of the coverage report [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/main/examples/fattree4/coverage/HTML_REPORT/index.html).




## Installing NetCov
Install NetCov using `pip`. A virtual environment and Python version 3.7 is recommended.
```sh
$ pip install netcov
```

NetCov leverages [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate HTML report. If you would like to use this feature, install LCOV using Homebrew (MacOS) or apt (Ubuntu):

Install `lcov` on MacOS using Homebrew:
```sh
$ brew install lcov
```
Install `lcov` on Ubuntu using apt:
```sh
$ sudo apt install lcov
```




## Usage
NetCov can be used seamlessly with `pybatfish`. It provides a hooked version of pybatfish APIs that automatically tracks coverage during the execution of supported pybatfish questions. 

### Using NetCov for an existing pybatfish script/notebook

It takes only two simple steps to measure coverage for your existing pybatfish scripts/notebooks.

1. For import, replace pybatfish client session with the one provided by NetCov:
```python
#from pybatfish.client.session import Session
from netcov import NetCovSession as Session
```
2. Generate coverage results at the end of your script. To print coverage metrics to the console, use `bf.cov.result()`. To generate HTML report, use `bf.cov.html_report()`.

### Use NetCov for a new pybatfish script/notebook 

We provide a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcBD2LhxqOQ) and an [example](examples/demo.ipynb) to help you get started. If you are new to pybatfish, we recommend reading the [pybatfish doc](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html) first. 


### Advanced

Sometimes not all information retrieved by Batfish questions are meant to be tested, for example, when you retrieve all RIB entries but only assert on a subset of them. To help NetCov model coverage more accurately, you can pause coverage tracking and add tested information use a NetCov API:
```
# pause coverage tracking to avoid over-estimation
bf.cov.pause()
routes = bf.q.routes(nodes="edge-0000").answer().frame()
bf.cov.resume()

# filter RIB entries to test
tested = routes[routes["Network"] == '0.0.0.0/0'].head(1)

# add tested route to coverage trace
bf.cov.add_tested_routes(tested)
```

`bf.cov.result()` prints coverage metrics using `logging` module and writes to `stderr` by default. To save the coverage report to file, you can customize logger by:
```python
import logging
fh = logging.FileHandler('cov.log')
logging.getLogger('netcov').addHandler(fh)
```
